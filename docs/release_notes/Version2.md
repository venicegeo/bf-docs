## Version 2.0

Date and version number of current changes: 12 April 2018, v2.0

Beachfront 2.0 builds on Beachfront 1.0 and Piazza and starts to combine the
two applications into one finding efficiencies.  These release notes contain
the Beachfront 1.0 and Piazza MVP since those versions of the software were not
ever officially delivered and granted ATO through NGA.  Beachfront 2.0 in UC
will enable users to securely login using GEOAxIS, search-activated PlanetDAS
provided imagery, execute coastline detection using an NDWI-based algorithm
service, and download tide-coordinated vector outputs after detection job
execution. Piazza capabilities have been absorbed into Beachfront and it will be
ATOâ€™d as one project, referred to as Beachfront_Piazza in this document going
forward.

The following additions and enhancements were made within the 2.0 release:

#### Beachfront User Interface:

-   Users will be able to interact with the Beachfront system through a
    map-driven user interface at <https://beachfront.gs.mil>
-   OSM Basemap Tiles will be the basemap until more become available

#### GeoAxis User Authentication:

-   Users will be able to login using their GeoAxis credentials (PKI,
    Disadvantaged User Account, Austere Account) through an OAuth2-enabled system

#### Searching Planet Data to run Coastline Detection on through PlanetDAS:

-   User-controlled search of active AOIs and TOIs of RapidEye, PlanetScope, and
    Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery can be made using the following filters:
    -   Spatial
    -   Temporal
    -   Cloud Cover
-   Users can choose between searching RapidEye, PlanetScope, or Sentinel-2
    imagery for candidate scenes/tiles

#### Scene/Tile Preview of Planet Data (provided by PlanetDAS):

-   Enables users to visually inspect image scenes/tiles provided by Planet DAS,
    e.g., Planet DAS tile server dependency, prior to detection job execution
-   Enables user download to a local machine
    -   Vector outputs will be in GeoJSON, GeoPackage, or Shapefile format
        (user's choice)

#### Single Scene Coastline Detection Job Execution (Register and Execute an Algorithm):

<!-- XXX: Not actually supported in the UI -->
<!-- -   Users can rename jobs if they choose (job name defaults to image Scene ID) -->

-   Users can execute coastline detection using a NDWI-based Python algorithm
    combined with avectorization component in one detection service
-   Beachfront fetches required Planet scene/tile analytic asset and stages for
    processing
-   Beachfront processes pixels with the algorithm and provides vector output
    of a shoreline detection.

#### Tide Prediction Service:

-   Beachfront calls a Global Tide Prediction Service upon scene selection using
    the centroid of the scene and time of collect in order to predict a tidal
    height, using a 24-hour low and high value, and decorates every output
    feature with this metadata

#### Output Vector Data:

-   Output vector metadata (at feature level) provides the following
    attribution (and JSON types) relevant to the job it was created by:

| classification    | text                      |

#### Jobs List:
-   Jobs List provides user ability to return to view historical jobs and their
    success/failure

#### Performance Enhancements:

-   Non-redundant processing and caching of detections, increasing
    performance and efficiency
-   API micro-service refactored to achieve better maintainability, reliability,
    and configuration integration with the deployment environment
-   Job executor service refactored for better horizontal scaling, increasing
    concurrent user capacity by 3x
-   Decreased processing time by 3x through various performance improvements

#### Bug Fixes:
-   Significant amount of work went into geting the NDWI to correct output
    coastline vectors onto the UI.

#### Features or functionality retired in Beachfront 1.0:

-   Piazza will no longer be refer to as a separate application.  By combining
    the two applications, the architecture was simplified.


#### Improvements from previous version:

-   N/A

## System Requirements:

Data exported from Beachfront 1.x is viewable in Boundless Desktop/QGIS, ArcGIS 10.3 (and later versions) with the Data Interoperability Extension, and GEOINT Viewer as GeoJSON and GeoPackage file formats
