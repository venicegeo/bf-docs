# Data

## Description

Most simply, Beachfront is a system that orchestrates a user-driven workflow where algorithms produce automated vector shoreline detections from available, processed satellite imagery.

In greater detail, Beachfront enables users to search for and choose their data input (currently a satellite image), select the detection algorithm they want to run, and then invoke Beachfront to process that imagery with an algorithm to produce vector data as an output.

Upon the user executing an algorithm in the UI, the Beachfront API receives this request and reads in pertinent metadata that belongs to the input image, takes that information and appends it to each vector output, so the vectors maintain the pedigree of the source satellite image.  In addition, Beachfront takes metadata from the tide service (a predicted tide height, 24 hour low height, and 24 hour high height), along with ancillary information such as: the classification of the data, the ‘not to be used for navigation or targeting’ disclaimer, the version of the algorithm at runtime, the user information, time of process, then appends all of this information to the correct vector data as well.  Every vector is attributed with this information so that later in analysis and/or production, these vectors can be used in conjunction with different data sources in an area of interest, and the pedigree of each vector remains.
